A quantum-inspired genetic algorithm comparision with genetic algorithm for k-means clustering
Abstract
In this paper we want to compare two diffrent algorithms for k-means clustering, first is Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm that we will implement it from Quantom Inspired genetic article, and second is a simple genetic algorithm from another article.
